### JPACRUDProject

## Overview
This project has been the first time creating a database, and first full stack solo project. I encountered several problems due to attempting to rename the project after realizing my initial idea would require multiple tables. I also had named one of the sql table columns 'condition' which lead to some issues.

## Topics
MySql
Spring Boot

## How To Run
1. Load to the index page. A button to add a tool is located at the top of the page. All tracked tools are listed below with a button to update the entry and a button to delete.
2. Clicking add tool takes the user to a add tool form. Brand and description are required to add a tool. On clicking submit the added tool is displayed.
3. Clicking update takes the user to an update form for that tool entry. Each field can be updated individually, and the page will refresh to display the update.
4. Clicking delete will remove the tool from the database and take the user to a page confirming the tool was removed.
